## Laboratory of Applied Mathematical Programming and Statistics

We believe in the power of knowledge and innovation as a transformation engine for society. We aim to leverage this transformation process through a highly collaborative environment involving students, senior researchers, a network of external research collaborators, and industry agents. The Laboratory of Applied Mathematical Programming and Statistics (LAMPS) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) is a research laboratory that leverages optimization and statistics to create new knowledge, test hypotheses and develop new tools for the industry and society, in particular for energy and financial sectors. LAMPS includes professors, researchers and students associated with the Electrical and Industrial Engineering Departments of PUC-Rio.
